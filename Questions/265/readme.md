# Permutation Palindrome

Write an efficient function that checks whether any permutation ↴ of an input string is a palindrome. ↴

## A permutation is an ordering of a set of items.

##### Example: all permutations of 'tom':

Examples:
- tom
- tmo
- omt
- otm
- mto
- mot
###### - Not to be confused with a combination, which is an unordered set or subset.

##### A palindrome is a string that's the same when read forward and backward.

Examples:

- civic
- mom
- anna
- kayak
- racecar

You can assume the input string only contains lowercase letters.

Examples:

- "civic" should return True
- "ivicc" should return True
- "civil" should return False
- "livci" should return False

###### -  "But 'ivicc' isn't a palindrome!"
####### If you had this thought, read the question again carefully. We're asking if any permutation of the string is a palindrome. Spend some extra time ensuring you fully understand the question before starting. Jumping in with a flawed understanding of the problem doesn't look good in an interview
